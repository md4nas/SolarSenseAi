SolarSense: Smart Solar Tracking System

Video Demo:  https://youtu.be/xqA-Qie9Vjc

Description:

SolarSense is an energy-efficient, IoT-based solar tracking system powered by the ESP8266 microcontroller. Designed to address the inefficiencies of fixed solar panels, SolarSense dynamically adjusts the panel orientation throughout the day to maintain a perpendicular angle to the sun, optimizing sunlight capture and improving power output by 6‚Äì8% even after accounting for the tracking system's own power consumption.

The project comprises two major components:

A hardware control system using ESP8266, servo motors, and stepper motors.

A custom Android application for user interface and manual control.

Project Objective

The main goal of this project is to create a low-cost and energy-efficient solar tracking solution that can increase energy yield using basic microcontrollers and motors. It should be capable of operating in both manual and auto modes:

In Auto Mode, the system calculates the sun‚Äôs position using azimuth angle formulas based on GPS coordinates and time.

In Manual Mode, the user can directly control the panel orientation using a Bluetooth-enabled Android app.

File Structure and Functionality

SolarSenseEsp8266 Repository

main.ino ‚Äî Core firmware for ESP8266 that reads data from the app and drives the servo and stepper motors.

WiFiSetup.h ‚Äî Stores Wi-Fi configuration details (if cloud extension is added).

MotorControl.h ‚Äî Contains functions for moving servos and stepper motors.

AngleCalculator.h ‚Äî Placeholder to integrate sun position formula if logic is moved to hardware in future.

SolarSenseAi Repository

MainActivity.java ‚Äî Android main activity managing the UI, Bluetooth service, and button click events.

BluetoothService.java ‚Äî Responsible for establishing and maintaining a Bluetooth connection.

SunPositionCalculator.java ‚Äî Computes azimuth angle based on user‚Äôs location and current time.

VoiceControlService.java ‚Äî Handles basic voice commands like "move left", "auto mode", etc.

activity_main.xml ‚Äî Layout XML defining the Android app interface.

Design Decisions

ESP8266 was chosen over ESP32 to keep costs low and reduce power usage. It also simplifies the Bluetooth setup using HC-05 modules.

Manual vs Auto Mode: Users may prefer direct control for experimentation or testing; hence, manual override was necessary.

Low Update Frequency: In Auto Mode, azimuth angle is updated every 5 minutes to reduce motor wear and power draw.

Decentralized Logic: The Android app performs sun position calculations to offload computation from ESP8266.

Challenges & Optimizations

Accurately syncing time without an RTC or internet required creative fallback logic.

Servo jittering was reduced by applying conditional movement only when deviation exceeded a certain angle threshold.

Motor position tracking required careful calibration to avoid panel over-rotation.

Final Thoughts

SolarSense is a compact, affordable solution for real-time solar panel tracking, perfect for educational projects, off-grid systems, or makers experimenting with green tech. With further enhancements like weather API integration, battery monitoring, or solar radiation sensors, this project could be production-grade.
